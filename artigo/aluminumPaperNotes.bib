@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="Convection cooling and heating is sometimes called Newton's Law of Cooling and Heating, in cases where the heat transfer coefficient is independent or relatively independent of the temperature difference between object and environment."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="For a horizontal cylindrical rod, $A_{\circledcirc } = A_{\circleddash }.$ In other words, the surface area of convection is the same as the surface are of radiation for a bare aluminum rod."}
